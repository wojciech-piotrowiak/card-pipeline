<h3>Welcome on my professional page</h3>
<div class="column">
  <p>
    I'm an experienced programmer, mostly focused on Java and web development.
    I also worked with .Net and created a few Desktop apps.
    I'm interested in new tech trends like noSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra), BigData, MeteorJS.
    As my main interest is programming I also like other activities like testing
    (writing automated tests and performance scripts), programming with TDD,
    setup CI on jenkins or bamboo.
    Please look into projects subpage to get more details about my experience.

    My main hobbies are DIY and running.
